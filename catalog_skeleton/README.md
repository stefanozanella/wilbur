## Skeleton Catalog Folder

This folder contains all the files used to generate a new Wilbur
catalog.

Each file, even if not having a `.erb` extension, is treated like a ERB
template. In addition, you can create a proper filesystem tree (with many
subdirectory levels) and it will be reproduced in the generated catalog.

**NOTE**: This file won't show up in generated catalogs.
